# Class Control (CMS GraphQL)

Class Control is a course management service, a GraphQL server designed to efficiently manage courses, chapters, and units within an educational platform.

Functional Requirements:
- **Read Operations**: Retrieve detailed information about courses, chapters, and units.
- **Creation Operations**: Create a new course, including chapters, and populate chapters with multiple units.
- **Update Operations**: Modify course, chapter, and unit details individually.
- **Deletion Operations**: Delete courses, chapters, and units individually.
- **Reordering**: Reorder chapters within a course and units within a chapter.
- **Authentication**: Sign-up, sign-in and sign-off a user.

Non-functional Requirements:
- **Scalability**: The system is built to handle growing data volumes and increasing user loads.
- **Low-Latency Performance**:  It prioritizes efficiency for heavy-write requests, delivering swift responses to users and minimizing latency.
